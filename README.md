Sequential Data Store >
The Sequential Data Store (SDS) is a cloud-based database that is optimized for storing sequential data, usually a time-series but anything that is indexed by an ordered sequence. You use SDS to store, retrieve, and analyze data. 

An SdsType (used interchangeably with type throughout documentation) defines the shape of a single measured event or object. An SdsStream (used interchangeably with stream throughout documentation) has an associated SdsType and stores a stream of events or objects that take the shape of that type.
